### Final Project02. Classic Algorithm (50%)
    1. (Done)Collatz Conjecture - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
    2. (Done)Sorting - mergeSort, bubble, selection, insertion sort
    3. Closest pair problem - The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry: given n points in metric space, find a pair of points with the smallest distance between them.
    4. Sieve of Eratosthenes - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).
### Final Project03. Graphs
    1. Eulerdian Path
    - Create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible.
    2. Connected Graph - Create a program which takes a graph as an input and outputs whether every node is connected or not.
    3. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges.
    4. Minimum Spanning Tree - (bellman_ford, floyd, kruskal) : Create a program which takes a connected, undirected graph with weights and outputs the minimum spanning tree of the graph
